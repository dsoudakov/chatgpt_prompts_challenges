# Testing prompts to produce desired results.

### Prompt Engineering

1. **Definition**: The practice of designing queries or instructions to guide machine learning models in producing desired outputs.
2. **Importance**: Influences model accuracy, relevancy, and utility.
3. **Techniques**: Varying phrasing, specifying context, adding constraints.

### Challenges

1. **Ambiguity**: Poorly crafted prompts can yield ambiguous or irrelevant answers.
2. **Expertise Required**: Requires understanding of model limitations and capabilities.
3. **Iterative Process**: Often requires multiple iterations for optimization.
4. **Consistency**: Hard to maintain output quality across different queries or topics.
